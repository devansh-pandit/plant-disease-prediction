# 🌱 Plant Disease Classifier  

A web-based application to predict plant diseases from leaf images, enabling early detection and prevention. The project leverages deep learning for image classification and offers an easy-to-use interface.  

## 🖥️ Features  
- Upload leaf images to classify plant diseases.  
- Real-time predictions with high accuracy.  
- Simple and intuitive interface using Streamlit.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the deep learning model.  
- **Streamlit**: For creating the user-friendly web interface.  
- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.  
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data manipulation.  
- **Google Colab**: For training the model in a cloud environment.  

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.8+  
- Required libraries: TensorFlow, Streamlit, NumPy  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-classifier.git  
   cd plant-disease-classifier  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

### Run the Application  
1. Launch the Streamlit app:  
   ``` 
   streamlit run app.py  
   ```  
2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.  

### Upload and Classify  
- Drag and drop or upload a leaf image (JPG, JPEG, PNG).  
- Click **Classify** to get the prediction.  

## 🔍 Model Training  
- **Dataset**: Used a publicly available dataset of plant leaf images with annotated disease labels.  
- **Training**: Performed on Google Colab using TensorFlow and CNN-based architecture.  
- **Accuracy**: Achieved XX% accuracy on test data.
